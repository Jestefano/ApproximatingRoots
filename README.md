# ApproximatingRoots

The focus of this project is to develop an algorithm to approximate the roots of an arbitrary complex polynomial.

This repo contains 4 folders (under develpment).

Two of them (*bachillerato* and *licenciatura*) include information about the theorems underlying 
the  algorithms, the other two (*programa - bachillerato* and *programa - licenciatura*) include
an implementation of the algorithms. 

The folder *programa - bachillerato* includes the algorithm using the iteration <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?z\mapsto{z^2}" />.

The folder *programa - licenciatura* includes the algorithm using the iteration  <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?z\mapsto{z^2+c}" />.
